# Climate change and fisheries

Climate change is driving shifts in the spatial distribution and
productivity of marine animals. These processes are reorganizing ocean
food webs, and leading to new species interactions. Fishers and
fisheries managers are thus responding to a rapidly changing seascape of
new risks, and new opportunities. However, existing management
structures are often not designed for flexibility and adaptation. If
they lag behind the emergence of novel environmental and economic
conditions, fisher livelihoods and fishing communities can be impacted.
Effectively responding to changing ecosystems and fisheries in the
California Current System will require research to serve management
needs, and science tailored to fishing communities. Future Seas is
linking ecological projections and modeling frameworks explicitly to
groups of species covered by Fishery Management Plans. Within these
management plans, species are categorized into ecologically similar
groups. Future Seas research is focused on three of these groups:
[coastal pelagic species](#cps), [highly migratory species](#hms), and
[groundfish](#gf).

### Coastal Pelagic Species {#cps}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Coastal pelagic species include Pacific sardine (*Sardinops sagax*),
northern anchovy (*Engraulis mordax*), and market squid (*Doryteuthis
opalescens*). These animals provide an abundant prey base for larger
predators such as tunas, billfishes, marine mammals, seabirds, sharks,
and groundfish. The recruitment and abundance of coastal pelagic species
in the California Current System can change rapidly from year-to-year,
responding to shifts in ocean conditions. Historical studies proposed
that warm conditions in the region favored sardine, while cooler
temperature favored anchovy. However, record warm temperatures during
the 2014-2016 North Pacific marine heatwave did not reverse the collapse
of the northern subpopulation of sardine, and instead marked the
beginning of a rapid increase in anchovy. The spatial distribution of
coastal pelagic species also responds rapidly to environmental
conditions. During the 2014-2016 heatwave, market squid expanded their
range into the Gulf of Alaska, and sardine spawning grounds shifted
hundreds of kilometers northwards. These redistributions can change the
forage base available to top predators, as well as impacting fishing
opportunities.

Coastal pelagic species support several important commercial fisheries.
Fishers targeting coastal pelagic species generally rely on a portfolio
of species, which varies regionally and temporally with species
availability. The fleet targeting these species is one of the largest
and most diverse in California, with the main targets being market
squid, sardine, mackerel and anchovy, although the sardine fishery has
been closed since 2015 due to low biomass. In 2022, coastal pelagic
species accounted for 15.5% of total West Coast landings by weight, and
generated \$90.6 million in ex-vessel revenue. Key issues for the
fishery include stabilizing catch from year to year, promoting
efficiency and profitability given the high temporal variability in
species availability and portfolio composition, and maintaining adequate
forage for predators. As coastal pelagic species support both larger
predators and commercial fisheries, fisheries managers balance the needs
of fishing fleets with those of the broader ecosystem.

::: {.column width="60%"}
Highly migratory species include tunas, such as Pacific bluefin tuna
(*Thunnus orientalis*) and albacore tuna (*T. alalunga*), billfishes,
such as swordfish (*Xiphias gladius*) and sharks. These species can
migrate very large distances as part of their life cycles. For example,
bluefin tuna and albacore spawn in the western North Pacific, but a
portion of juveniles migrate to the California Current System to forage
when they are about 1 – 3 years old. Albacore also migrate seasonally
between the California Current System and the offshore North Pacific.
Highly migratory species are particularly adept at using their ocean
habitat across three dimensions, and can dive to several hundred meters
depth to target mesopelagic prey. They often specialize on prey such as
anchovy and sardine when those resources are abundant, but can rapidly
switch to other prey such as cephalopods or crustaceans in response to
changing availability.

Albacore support the most lucrative fishery for a highly migratory
species off the US West Coast. The commercial albacore fishery operates
primarily out of Pacific Northwest ports in Oregon and Washington, using
hook-and-line or troll gear. Importantly, the US and Canadian albacore
fisheries are currently open-access, providing valuable “insurance” as
other fisheries (e.g., for salmon and crab) have become more volatile or
less accessible. In 2023, albacore landings totaled 3,298 metric tons,
generating \$9.6 million in ex-vessel revenue. Swordfish were
historically targeted by a drift gillnet fishery operating off
California, but other gears (such as deep-set buoy gear) are now being
phased in. In 2023, swordfish landings totaled 97 metric tons, worth
\$874,928 in ex-vessel revenue. Landings and revenue of bluefin tuna are
still low compared to albacore and swordfish, but this species has
become more abundant in the southern California Current over the past 10
years, potentially providing more fishing opportunities for both
commercial and recreational fishers.

Highly migratory species are managed internationally by the
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and the Western Central Pacific
Fisheries Council, and along the US West Coast by the Pacific Fishery
Management Council. Due to their mobility, highly migratory species can
respond rapidly to climate-driven changes in thermal habitat or prey
resources. They can therefore move across static management boundaries,
potentially challenging existing fisheries management agreements.

### Groundfish {#gf}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
The term “groundfish” encompasses more than 90 species of fish living on
or near the seafloor, such as flatfish (e.g., Dover sole, *Microstomus
pacificus*), sablefish (*Anoplopoma fimbria*), and deep dwelling
demersal rockfishes (*Sebastes* spp.). We categorize Pacific hake
(*Merluccius productus*) as groundfish as well, though as a ‘midwater’
species they are found from the seafloor up to the middle of the water
column. Hake prey on other groundfish species, but are also preyed upon
by piscivorous species like lingcod (*Ophiodon elongatus*) and Humboldt
squid (*Dosidicus gigas*). Sablefish also act as both predator and prey
during different portions of their lifecycle, and cannibalism between
adults and juveniles has been observed. Juvenile sablefish feed
primarily on copepods, while adult sablefish feed on a diverse set of
prey that includes other fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. The
spatial distribution of groundfish is primarily associated with
environmental conditions near the sea-floor, such as bottom
temperature,bottom oxygen, and sediment or rocky habitat. Although they
are not as mobile as highly migratory species (e.g., tunas), hake have
been observed to move from northern California to around Vancouver
Island in spring and summer, and may migrate further north in warmer
years.

Pacific hake support one of the largest and most valuable groundfish
fisheries on the West Coast, with a total value of \> \$300 million to
the US. (Malick et al. 2020). They are targeted primarily by mid-water
trawl gear. Hake have been managed under the international Pacific
Hake/Whiting treaty since 2012, and a bilateral agreement has governed
the US and Canada catches of hake since 2005. Sablefish are also highly
valuable commercially. Management measures include seasons, size limits,
trip-limits, and a complex permit system. Climate change may already be
impacting sablefish distribution and availability, and in the future,
they may shift into deeper offshore waters, becoming less accessible to
fishing fleets. As temperatures warm, some groundfish may be pushed
further north, increasing potential for transboundary issues and
conflicts.
