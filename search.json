    "text": "Climate change and fisheries\nClimate change is driving shifts in the spatial distribution and productivity of marine animals. These processes are reorganizing ocean food webs, and leading to new species interactions. Fishers and fisheries managers are thus responding to a rapidly changing seascape of new risks, and new opportunities. However, existing management structures are often not designed for flexibility and adaptation. If they lag behind the emergence of novel environmental and economic conditions, fisher livelihoods and fishing communities can be impacted. Effectively responding to changing ecosystems and fisheries in the California Current System will require research to serve management needs, and science tailored to fishing communities. Future Seas is linking ecological projections and modeling frameworks explicitly to groups of species covered by Fishery Management Plans. Within these management plans, species are categorized into ecologically similar groups. Future Seas research is focused on three of these groups: coastal pelagic species, highly migratory species, and groundfish.\n\nCoastal Pelagic Species\n\n\nCoastal pelagic species include Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), and market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens). These animals provide an abundant prey base for larger predators such as tunas, billfishes, marine mammals, seabirds, sharks, and groundfish. The recruitment and abundance of coastal pelagic species in the California Current System can change rapidly from year-to-year, responding to shifts in ocean conditions. Historical studies proposed that warm conditions in the region favored sardine, while cooler temperature favored anchovy. However, record warm temperatures during the 2014-2016 North Pacific marine heatwave did not reverse the collapse of the northern subpopulation of sardine, and instead marked the beginning of a rapid increase in anchovy. The spatial distribution of coastal pelagic species also responds rapidly to environmental conditions. During the 2014-2016 heatwave, market squid expanded their range into the Gulf of Alaska, and sardine spawning grounds shifted hundreds of kilometers northwards. These redistributions can change the forage base available to top predators, as well as impacting fishing opportunities.\nCoastal pelagic species support several important commercial fisheries. Fishers targeting coastal pelagic species generally rely on a portfolio of species, which varies regionally and temporally with species availability. The fleet targeting these species is one of the largest and most diverse in California, with the main targets being market squid, sardine, mackerel and anchovy, although the sardine fishery has been closed since 2015 due to low biomass. In 2022, coastal pelagic species accounted for 15.5% of total West Coast landings by weight, and generated $90.6 million in ex-vessel revenue. Key issues for the fishery include stabilizing catch from year to year, promoting efficiency and profitability given the high temporal variability in species availability and portfolio composition, and maintaining adequate forage for predators. As coastal pelagic species support both larger predators and commercial fisheries, fisheries managers balance the needs of fishing fleets with those of the broader ecosystem.\nLearn more about coastal pelagic species here and here.\n\n\n\n\nPacific sardine(Sardinops sagax)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly Migratory Species\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbacore tuna(Thunnus alalunga)\n\n\n\n\n\nSwordfish(Xiphias gladius)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly migratory species include tunas, such as Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) and albacore tuna (T. alalunga), billfishes, such as swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and sharks. These species can migrate very large distances as part of their life cycles. For example, bluefin tuna and albacore spawn in the western North Pacific, but a portion of juveniles migrate to the California Current System to forage when they are about 1 – 3 years old. Albacore also migrate seasonally between the California Current System and the offshore North Pacific. Highly migratory species are particularly adept at using their ocean habitat across three dimensions, and can dive to several hundred meters depth to target mesopelagic prey. They often specialize on prey such as anchovy and sardine when those resources are abundant, but can rapidly switch to other prey such as cephalopods or crustaceans in response to changing availability.\nAlbacore support the most lucrative fishery for a highly migratory species off the US West Coast. The commercial albacore fishery operates primarily out of Pacific Northwest ports in Oregon and Washington, using hook-and-line or troll gear. Importantly, the US and Canadian albacore fisheries are currently open-access, providing valuable “insurance” as other fisheries (e.g., for salmon and crab) have become more volatile or less accessible. In 2023, albacore landings totaled 3,298 metric tons, generating $9.6 million in ex-vessel revenue. Swordfish were historically targeted by a drift gillnet fishery operating off California, but other gears (such as deep-set buoy gear) are now being phased in. In 2023, swordfish landings totaled 97 metric tons, worth $874,928 in ex-vessel revenue. Landings and revenue of bluefin tuna are still low compared to albacore and swordfish, but this species has become more abundant in the southern California Current over the past 10 years, potentially providing more fishing opportunities for both commercial and recreational fishers.\nHighly migratory species are managed internationally by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Council, and along the US West Coast by the Pacific Fishery Management Council. Due to their mobility, highly migratory species can respond rapidly to climate-driven changes in thermal habitat or prey resources. They can therefore move across static management boundaries, potentially challenging existing fisheries management agreements.\nLearn more about highly migratory species here and here.\n\n\n\n\nGroundfish\n\n\nThe term “groundfish” encompasses more than 90 species of fish living on or near the seafloor, such as flatfish (e.g., Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus), sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), and deep dwelling demersal rockfishes (Sebastes spp.). We categorize Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) as groundfish as well, though as a ‘midwater’ species they are found from the seafloor up to the middle of the water column. Hake prey on other groundfish species, but are also preyed upon by piscivorous species like lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) and Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas). Sablefish also act as both predator and prey during different portions of their lifecycle, and cannibalism between adults and juveniles has been observed. Juvenile sablefish feed primarily on copepods, while adult sablefish feed on a diverse set of prey that includes other fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. The spatial distribution of groundfish is primarily associated with environmental conditions near the sea-floor, such as bottom temperature,bottom oxygen, and sediment or rocky habitat. Although they are not as mobile as highly migratory species (e.g., tunas), hake have been observed to move from northern California to around Vancouver Island in spring and summer, and may migrate further north in warmer years.\nPacific hake support one of the largest and most valuable groundfish fisheries on the West Coast, with a total value of &gt; $300 million to the US. (Malick et al. 2020). They are targeted primarily by mid-water trawl gear. Hake have been managed under the international Pacific Hake/Whiting treaty since 2012, and a bilateral agreement has governed the US and Canada catches of hake since 2005. Sablefish are also highly valuable commercially. Management measures include seasons, size limits, trip-limits, and a complex permit system. Climate change may already be impacting sablefish distribution and availability, and in the future, they may shift into deeper offshore waters, becoming less accessible to fishing fleets. As temperatures warm, some groundfish may be pushed further north, increasing potential for transboundary issues and conflicts.\nLearn more about groundfish here and here."

    "text": "Figure 1: Participation networks for each CPS fleet segment for 2005-2014. CPS-associated metiers are shown in blue with their labels bolded; everything else is shown in beige. Nodes represent fishing metiers, and their size represents their percentage contribution to total revenue generated by each fleet segment during each time period. The width of the lines connecting the nodes represents the percentage of vessels in each fleet segment participating in each pair of fisheries. See Quezada et al. 2023 for a detailed description of each fleet segment.\nThe Future Seas social science and economics teams are working to understand how projected changes in species distribution and abundance will impact the future resilience of fishing communities.\nQuezada et al. (2023) investigated historical landings per vessel of coastal pelagic species (CPS, here sardine, anchovy, market squid) in response to shifts in their availability, to understand how the fleet may respond to future changes. Shifts in availability were derived from environmentally-driven SDM output averaged over fishing grounds. They found that responses to historical shifts in species availability were dependent on fleet segment and associated vessel strategies (e.g., opportunist versus specialist fleets, see Figure 1 for overview of fleet segments), in addition to market conditions, regulations, and availability of other target species. This work also highlighted that existing characteristics of some fleet segments, such as the ability to switch between a diverse set of target species, can confer future adaptation potential. See Quezada et al. 2023 to learn more! The code used for the analysis is available at https://github.com/futureseas/EconAnalysis.\nThe Future Seas team focused on communities will leverage existing methods for assessing the climate vulnerability of fishing communities within a social-ecological framework (Colburn et al. 2016; Figure 2), including those specific to West Coast fisheries (Koehn et al. 2022; Norman et al. 2022; Frawley et al. 2021), and explore the applicability of these measures to individual commercial harvesters. This will be accomplished by pairing community level measures with data from a longitudinal West Coast fishery participation survey (Holland et al. 2019; Norman et al. 2022). These data will enable examination of how secondary vulnerability measures are related to individual harvester responses to exogenous shocks, including closures and other management interventions. The pairing of these data with climate-oriented community measures (Koehn et al. 2022) allows for further exploration of varying adaptive capacities, at the level of the individual, fleet and aggregated IO-PAC port.\nClimate social-ecological vulnerability measures will also be compared with regional climate risk perceptions by building upon the PFMC Climate and Communities Initiative scenarios and considering how place-based vulnerability relates to regional perceptions about future challenges and mitigation strategies. Regional perceptions will also be compared across fleet and IO-PAC port level scales while considering their collective vulnerability to climate change. Finally, these perceptions will be compared with the future projections of ecosystem states and management responses produced by Atlantis. Insights gained through this process can potentially serve to inform future stakeholder engagement for enhancing climate resilience of fishing communities."

We use physical and biogeochemical conditions from an ensemble of high-resolution (~0.1°) projections for the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) forced by three earth system models (ESMs) belonging to the CMIP6 archive under the “middle of the road” shared-socio-economic pathway (SSP2-4.5): GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, UKESM1-0-LL. Output from these ESMs provide the surface and ocean boundary conditions for an implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) coupled with a biogeochemical model, the North Pacific Ecosystem Model for Understanding Regional Oceanography (NEMURO). Prior to downscaling, the output from the ESMs is bias corrected using a time-varying delta approach that includes the daily variability in the atmospheric forcing and the monthly variability in the ocean boundary conditions, following Pozo Buil et al. (2021). The regional modeling strategy includes two domains (Figure 1). The first domain includes the northeast Pacific (ROMS-NEP), extending from Baja California to the Gulf of Alaska. In this domain only the physical ocean circulation is resolved. This broader northeastern Pacific region is essential for capturing migratory patterns of shared, transboundary stocks in the CPS, HMS, and groundfish Fishery Management Plans. The second domain covers the Atlantis domain from Baja California to British Columbia (ROMS- CCLME), and the solution will include both ocean physics and biogeochemistry."

    "text": "Many fish species are shifting spatial distributions in response to climate change, but projecting these shifts and measuring their impact at fine scales are challenging. We present a simulation that projects change in fishery landings due to spatial distribution shifts, by combining regional ocean and biogeochemical models (forced by three earth system models, ESMs: GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-MR), correlative models for species distribution and port-level landings, and a simulation framework which provides realistic values for species abundance and fishery conditions using an historical “reference period”. We demonstrate this approach for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine, an iconic commercial species for the U.S. West Coast. We found a northward shift in sardine landings (based on the northern subpopulation’s habitat suitability), with projected declines at southern ports (20%–50% decline by 2080) and an increase (up to 50%) or no change at northern ports, and this was consistent across the three ESMs. Total sardine landings were more uncertain, with HadGEM2 indicating a 20% decline from 2000 to 15 levels by 2070 (a rate of 170 mt/y), IPSL a 10% increase (115 mt/y), and GFDL an 15% increase by the year ~2050 followed by a sharp decrease. The ESMs also differed in their projected change to the timing of the fishing season and frequency of fishery closures.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Time-area closures are a valuable tool for mitigating fisheries bycatch. There is increasing recognition that dynamic closures, which have boundaries that vary across space and time, can be more effective than static closures at protecting mobile species in dynamic environments. We created a management strategy evaluation to compare static and dynamic closures in a simulated fishery based on the California drift gillnet swordfish fishery, with closures aimed at reducing bycatch of leatherback turtles. We tested eight operating models that varied swordfish and leatherback distributions, and within each evaluated the performance of three static and five dynamic closure strategies. We repeated this under 20 and 50% simulated observer coverage to alter the data available for closure creation. We found that static closures can be effective for reducing bycatch of species with more geographically associated distributions, but to avoid redistributing bycatch the static areas closed should be based on potential (not just observed) bycatch. Only dynamic closures were effective at reducing bycatch for more dynamic leatherback distributions, and they generally reduced bycatch risk more than they reduced target catch. Dynamic closures were less likely to redistribute fishing into rarely fished areas, by leaving open pockets of lower risk habitat, but these closures were often fragmented which would create practical challenges for fishers and managers and require a mobile fleet. Given our simulation’s catch rates, 20% observer coverage was sufficient to create useful closures and increasing coverage to 50% added only minor improvement in closure performance. Even strict static or dynamic closures reduced leatherback bycatch by only 30–50% per season, because the simulated leatherback distributions were broad and open areas contained considerable bycatch risk. Perfect knowledge of the leatherback distribution provided an additional 5–15% bycatch reduction over a dynamic closure with realistic predictive accuracy. This moderate level of bycatch reduction highlights the limitations of redistributing fishing effort to reduce bycatch of broadly distributed and rarely encountered species, and indicates that, for these species, spatial management may work best when used with other bycatch mitigation approaches. We recommend future research explores methods for considering model uncertainty in the spatial and temporal resolution of dynamic closures."

Even strict static or dynamic closures reduced leatherback bycatch by only 30–50% per season, because the simulated leatherback distributions were broad and open areas contained considerable bycatch risk. Perfect knowledge of the leatherback distribution provided an additional 5–15% bycatch reduction over a dynamic closure with realistic predictive accuracy. This moderate level of bycatch reduction highlights the limitations of redistributing fishing effort to reduce bycatch of broadly distributed and rarely encountered species, and indicates that, for these species, spatial management may work best when used with other bycatch mitigation approaches. We recommend future research explores methods for considering model uncertainty in the spatial and temporal resolution of dynamic closures."

The forcing of the regional ocean model is constructed with a “time-varying delta” method, which removes the mean bias of the ESM forcing and resolves the full transient ocean response from 1980 to 2100. We found that all models agree in the direction of the future change in offshore waters: an intensification of upwelling favorable winds in the northern CCS, an overall surface warming, and an enrichment of nitrate and corresponding decrease in dissolved oxygen below the surface mixed layer. However, differences in projections of these properties arise in the coastal region, producing different responses of the future biogeochemical variables. Two of the models display an increase of surface chlorophyll in the northern CCS, consistent with a combination of higher nitrate content in source waters and an intensification of upwelling favorable winds. All three models display a decrease of chlorophyll in the southern CCS, which appears to be driven by decreased upwelling favorable winds and enhanced stratification, and, for the HadGEM2-ES forced run, decreased nitrate content in upwelling source waters in nearshore regions.

Though diversification and flexibility have historically helped marine resource users negotiate risk and adversity, much of modern fisheries management treats fishermen as specialists using specific gear types to target specific species.

Our analysis indicates that recent social–ecological changes have had heterogenous impacts upon the livelihood strategies favoured by different segments of regional fishing fleets. As ecological change and regulatory reform have restricted access to a number of fisheries, many of the regional small (&lt;45 ft) and medium (45–60 ft) boat fishermen who continue to pursue diverse livelihood strategies have increasingly relied upon the ability to opportunistically target albacore in coastal waters while retaining more of the value generated by such catch. In contrast, large vessels (&gt;60 ft) targeting albacore are more specialized now than previously observed, even as participation in multiple fisheries has become increasingly common for this size class. In describing divergent trajectories associated with the albacore fishery, one of the US West Coast’s last open-access fisheries, we highlight the diverse strategies and mechanisms utilized to sustain fisheries livelihoods in the modern era while arguing that alternative approaches to management and licensing may be required to maintain the viability of small-scale fishing operations worldwide moving forward."

However, it is vital to assess how different statistical methods behave under novel environmental conditions before using these models for management advice, and to consider whether future projections based on these techniques are biologically reasonable. In this study, we built SDMs for adults and larvae of two ecologically important pelagic fishes in the California Current System (CCS): Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). We used five different SDM methods, ranging from simple [thermal niche model (TNM)] to complex (artificial neural networks). Our results show that some SDMs trained on data collected between 2003 and 2013 lost substantial predictive skill when applied to observations from more recent years, when ocean temperatures associated with a marine heatwave were outside the range of historical measurements. This decrease in skill was particularly apparent for adult sardine, which showed non-stationary relationships between catch locations and sea surface temperature (SST) through time. While sardine adults and larvae shifted their distributions markedly during the marine heatwave, anchovy largely maintained their historical spatiotemporal distributions. Our results suggest that correlative relationships between species and their environment can become unreliable during anomalous conditions. Understanding the underlying physiology of marine species is therefore essential for the construction of SDMs that are robust to rapidly changing environments.

For fisheries targeting highly mobile species, the economic impact of a closure may by highly dynamic, depending on the current suitability of the closed area for the target species.\nWe present an analysis to quantify the fine-scale economic impact of time-area closures: the ‘lost economic opportunity’, which is the percentage of total potential profit for an entire fishing season that occurs within and during a time-area closure. Our analysis integrates a spatially explicit and environment-informed catch model with a utility model that quantifies fishing revenues and costs, and thus incorporates a dynamic target species distribution in the estimated economic impact of a closure. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating the economic impact of the Loggerhead Conservation Area (LCA) on California’s drift gillnet swordfish Xiphias gladius fishery.\nThe lost economic opportunity due to the LCA time-area closure ranged from 0% to 6% per season, with variation due to port location and trip duration, as well as inter-annual changes in swordfish distribution. This increased by 40%–90% when a seasonally varying swordfish price was considered.\nThere was a clear signal in economic impact associated with a shift from warm to cool conditions in the California Current following the 1998 El Niño, with increased lost economic opportunity from 1999. This signal was due to higher swordfish catch inside the LCA during the cool phase, associated with increased water column mixing, and due to higher catches outside the LCA in the warmer phase, associated with increased sea-surface temperature.\nSynthesis and applications. We found small economic impact from a fishery closure, but with meaningful inter-annual variation due to environmental change and the dynamic distribution of a target species.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Predicting changes in the abundance and distribution of small pelagic fish species in response to anthropogenic climate forcing is of paramount importance due to the ecological and socioeconomic importance of these species, especially in eastern boundary current upwelling regions. Coastal upwelling systems are notorious for the wide range of spatial (from local to basin) and temporal (from days to decades) scales influencing their physical and biogeochemical environments and, thus, forage fish habitat. Bridging those scales can be achieved by using high-resolution regional models that integrate global climate forcing downscaled from coarser resolution earth system models. Here, “end-to-end” projections for 21st century sardine population dynamics and catch in the California Current system (CCS) are generated by coupling three dynamically downscaled earth system model solutions to an individual-based fish model and an agent-based fishing fleet model. Simulated sardine population biomass during 2000–2100 exhibits primarily low-frequency (decadal) variability, and a progressive poleward shift driven by thermal habitat preference. The magnitude of poleward displacement varies noticeably under lower and higher warming conditions (500 and 800 km, respectively). Following the redistribution of the sardine population, catch is projected to increase by 50–70% in the northern CCS and decrease by 30–70% in the southern and central CCS. However, the late-century increase in sardine abundance (and hence, catch) in the northern CCS exhibits a large ensemble spread and is not statistically identical across the three downscaled projections. Overall, the results illustrate the benefit of using dynamical downscaling from multiple earth system models as input to high-resolution regional end-to-end (“physics to fish”) models for projecting population responses of higher trophic organisms to global climate change."

    "title": "Projected Shifts in 21st Century Sardine Distribution and Catch in the California Current",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Predicting changes in the abundance and distribution of small pelagic fish species in response to anthropogenic climate forcing is of paramount importance due to the ecological and socioeconomic importance of these species, especially in eastern boundary current upwelling regions. Coastal upwelling systems are notorious for the wide range of spatial (from local to basin) and temporal (from days to decades) scales influencing their physical and biogeochemical environments and, thus, forage fish habitat. Bridging those scales can be achieved by using high-resolution regional models that integrate global climate forcing downscaled from coarser resolution earth system models. Here, “end-to-end” projections for 21st century sardine population dynamics and catch in the California Current system (CCS) are generated by coupling three dynamically downscaled earth system model solutions to an individual-based fish model and an agent-based fishing fleet model. Simulated sardine population biomass during 2000–2100 exhibits primarily low-frequency (decadal) variability, and a progressive poleward shift driven by thermal habitat preference. The magnitude of poleward displacement varies noticeably under lower and higher warming conditions (500 and 800 km, respectively). Following the redistribution of the sardine population, catch is projected to increase by 50–70% in the northern CCS and decrease by 30–70% in the southern and central CCS. However, the late-century increase in sardine abundance (and hence, catch) in the northern CCS exhibits a large ensemble spread and is not statistically identical across the three downscaled projections. Overall, the results illustrate the benefit of using dynamical downscaling from multiple earth system models as input to high-resolution regional end-to-end (“physics to fish”) models for projecting population responses of higher trophic organisms to global climate change."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Motivated by a need for climate-informed living marine resource management, increased emphasis has been placed on regional end-to-end modeling frameworks designed to project climate impacts on marine ecosystems and evaluate the efficacy of potential management strategies under changing conditions. The ‘Future Seas’ project was initiated with a focus on three fisheries (Pacific sardine, swordfish, and albacore tuna) in the California Current System (CCS). This work leverages a suite of climate, ocean, ecosystem, and economic models to project physical, ecological, and socio-economic change, evaluate management strategies, and quantify uncertainty in model projections. Here we describe the components of the modeling framework, considerations underlying choices made in model development, engagement with stakeholders, and key physical, ecological, and socio-economic results to date, including projections to 2100. Our broad aims are to (i) synthesize a large body of climate and fisheries research that has been conducted, and continues, under the Future Seas umbrella, and (ii) provide insight and recommendations to those pursuing similar efforts for other applications and in other regions. In general, our results indicate that all three species will likely shift their distributions (predominantly poleward) in the future, which impacts accessibility to fishing fleets, spatial management, and quota allocation. For similar integrative climate-to-fisheries projections, we recommend attention is given to: recognizing potential biases arising from differences between the climate products used for ecological model fitting and those used for model projection; how sources of projection uncertainty are prioritized, incorporated, and communicated; and quantitatively linking scenarios – especially socio-economic scenarios – with climate and ecological projections."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Small pelagic fish are important marine ecosystem components and highly variable fisheries resources. In the California Current upwelling system, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) has supported important fisheries in the past, but contrary to expectations, remains at low biomass despite recent warm ocean conditions. We developed a data-driven, process-based population model that reproduces fluctuations of the US Pacific sardine population based on ocean temperature, early life stage and adult food, and upwelling strength. The lack of sardine recovery after 2014 can be explained by reduced food availability. Ensemble projections for the 21st century driven by downscaled ocean-biogeochemical simulations under three Earth system models (ESMs) show a likely recovery to early 2000s sardine abundance and catch by mid-century, due to increased recruitment. Ecological process uncertainty (ensemble configuration range) is of the same magnitude as uncertainty among ESM projections, and uncertainty related to the thermal optimum of early life stages dominates after 2070. Even for a fish species presumably favoured by warmer conditions, future climate projections entail risks of stock declines in food-limited years and when passing unknown thermal optima. Quantification of combined environmental driver impacts and sources of uncertainty to projections under novel conditions open new pathways for environment-responsive fisheries management strategies."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A 2-day virtual stakeholder engagement workshop in support of the NOAA-funded Future Seas project was held November 28 and 29, 2022. Attendees included academic and government scientists as well as representatives of the National Marine Fisheries Service West Coast Region, the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, state agencies (California, Oregon, and Washington Departments of Fish and Wildlife), the Quinault Indian Nation, CPS (coastal pelagic species) fishermen, and CPS processors. The workshop began with an overview of the Future Seas project, including project aims for the recent phase 2 of the project, and a summary of the results obtained from phase 1. The rest of day 1 was dedicated to the socio- economic part of the project, while day 2 focused on the Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). The discussion was lively and productive and is detailed in this report. With input from all represented stakeholders, the Future Seas team was able to synthesize for the CPS fishery the observed target species dynamics, the key drivers that affect fishing operations, species portfolio and switching behavior, harvest location, port landings decisions and “no fishing” decisions, and key climate vulnerabilities, management strategies and performance metrics. These findings will guide the development and execution of the models elaborated for the project and ensure that they address the concerns and ideas of stakeholders. Attendees expressed appreciation for being considered in the modeling design and have interest in follow-up meetings with the researchers of the project as needed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A 2-day virtual stakeholder engagement workshop in support of the NOAA-funded Future Seas project was held November 28 and 29, 2022. Attendees included academic and government scientists as well as representatives of the National Marine Fisheries Service West Coast Region, the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, state agencies (California, Oregon, and Washington Departments of Fish and Wildlife), the Quinault Indian Nation, CPS (coastal pelagic species) fishermen, and CPS processors. The workshop began with an overview of the Future Seas project, including project aims for the recent phase 2 of the project, and a summary of the results obtained from phase 1. The rest of day 1 was dedicated to the socio- economic part of the project, while day 2 focused on the Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). The discussion was lively and productive and is detailed in this report. With input from all represented stakeholders, the Future Seas team was able to synthesize for the CPS fishery the observed target species dynamics, the key drivers that affect fishing operations, species portfolio and switching behavior, harvest location, port landings decisions and “no fishing” decisions, and key climate vulnerabilities, management strategies and performance metrics.

Centre of gravity and their corresponding 1± standard deviation calculated across species and ESM are represented for the historical (green crosses) and future (orange crosses) periods. From Lezama Ochoa et al. (2024).\nAs climate change leads to novel ocean conditions, marine species are shifting their spatial distributions. The Future Seas Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) team is building models to anticipate the magnitude and direction of these shifts. We are focusing on a suite of species, including coastal pelagics (e.g., sardine, anchovy: Muhling et al. 2020), groundfish (e.g., sablefish: Liu et al. 2023), highly migratory species (e.g. tunas), and protected species (e.g., whales, turtles: Lezama Ochoa et al. 2024).\nWe train our SDMs using biological observations from fisheries, NOAA surveys, and animal telemetry, in combination with environmental predictors from ocean models and satellite sensors. SDMs are then applied to downscaled projections of future conditions (see Ocean and Climate Modeling) to show how animals with different physiologies and life histories may respond to climate change in our region (Figure 1, Figure 2).\nSDM outputs are condensed into indicators for inclusion in Ecosystem Status Reports and other management-relevant products. They are also used to inform the Atlantis ecosystem model, socioeconomic analyses, and other aspects of Future Seas research."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Future Seas team is working to develop and calculate metrics of adaptive capacity for communities involved in the groundfish industries on the U.S. East and West Coasts. Specifically, they aim to identify fishery participants that have demonstrated the flexibility to change target species, port of landing, location of fishing grounds, or other aspects of their fishing practices that may allow communities to persist during this period of rapid environmental change.\nGroundfish have long been a cornerstone of commercial fisheries along both the East and West Coasts of the United States. For centuries, fishers have employed a variety of methods—such as nets, hook and line, longline, and pots—to target a diverse range of species, including flatfish, rockfish, and gadids. The National Marine Fisheries Service has played a crucial role in rebuilding many groundfish stocks in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans after significant population declines in the 1980s and 1990s. To curb overfishing and improve efficiency, regional fisheries management councils introduced catch share programs for the Northeast (2010) and West Coast (2011) groundfish trawl fisheries.\nThe groundfish industry is highly diverse, encompassing small-scale operations from coastal communities deeply dependent on fisheries, as well as large corporate entities owning multiple vessels. These fisheries are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes, such as shifts in temperature, pH, and oceanographic patterns driven by climate change. However, the implications of these changes—on fish population abundance and distribution, and the subsequent effects on fishing communities—remain uncertain.\nThe team is also exploring how differences between the East and West Coasts, including bathymetry, the rate of environmental change, management structures, and coastal infrastructure, influence the flexibility dimension of adaptive capacity of these communities (Cinner et al. 2018)."

    "text": "Figure 1: MSE framework for Pacific sardine from Wildermuth et al. (2023).\nThe Management Strategy Evaluation team uses a closed-loop computer simulation tool, called Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), to assess robustness of current or alternative management rules to climate change. MSE is a multi-model framework that simulates potential future scenarios of the population, fisheries and/or ecosystem (called operating models) as well as the management system, from data generation to stock status estimation with a stock assessment model, to management measure implementation. Like a flight simulator, MSE enables us to test performance of a management strategy given a set of management objectives, in a virtual world. We would not expect a management strategy to work well in reality, if it does not perform well in a computer simulation.\nMSE can be used to simulation test current and alternative management strategies under potential future states to examine if management strategies are climate robust. Those potential future states scenarios are developed using the Future Seas suite of statistical and process-based models linked to future projections of California Current oceanography, and include potential future scenarios of recruitment, growth, natural mortality, distribution and food web-interactions.\nWe recently completed an MSE for sardine that evaluated robustness of the assessment and harvest control rule to projected changes in sardine recruitment (Wildermuth et al. 2023, Figure 1). We found that there was no indication of increased assessment error under projected changes in sardine recruitment. Furthermore, it was also shown that the current sardine assessment process and frequency can effectively track changes in the population status of sardine, making current management rules robust to changes in sardine recruitment as compared to more static approaches. Other harvest control rules that are responsive to environmentally driven changes by using dynamic reference points were also found to improve outcomes compared to static management. Management performance for sardine in a changing climate likely depends on frequent, responsive monitoring and assessment. See Wildermuth et al. 2023 to learn more! The simulation code is also available at https://github.com/futureseas/SardineMSE/tree/main. We are currently working on an ecosystem based MSE using the Atlantis ecosystem model to asses performance of forage fish harvest rules to climate-driven ecosystem change, results to come soon!"
