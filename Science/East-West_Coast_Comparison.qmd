The Future Seas team is working to develop and calculate metrics of adaptive capacity for
communities involved in the groundfish industries on the U.S. East and West Coasts.
Specifically, they aim to identify fishery participants that have demonstrated the flexibility to
change target species, port of landing, location of fishing grounds, or other aspects of their
fishing practices that may allow communities to persist during this period of rapid environmental
change.

Groundfish have long been a cornerstone of commercial fisheries along both the East and West
Coasts of the United States. For centuries, fishers have employed a variety of methods—such as
nets, hook and line, longline, and pots—to target a diverse range of species, including flatfish,
rockfish, and gadids. The National Marine Fisheries Service has played a crucial role in
rebuilding many groundfish stocks in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans after significant
population declines in the 1980s and 1990s. To curb overfishing and improve efficiency,
regional fisheries management councils introduced catch share programs for the Northeast
(2010) and West Coast (2011) groundfish trawl fisheries.

The groundfish industry is highly diverse, encompassing small-scale operations from coastal
communities deeply dependent on fisheries, as well as large corporate entities owning multiple
vessels. These fisheries are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes, such as shifts in
temperature, pH, and oceanographic patterns driven by climate change. However, the
implications of these changes—on fish population abundance and distribution, and the
subsequent effects on fishing communities—remain uncertain.

The team is also exploring how differences between the East and West Coasts, including
bathymetry, the rate of environmental change, management structures, and coastal infrastructure,
influence the flexibility dimension of adaptive capacity of these communities (Cinner et al.
2018).
