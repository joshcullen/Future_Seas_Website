The Management Strategy Evaluation team uses a closed-loop computer simulation tool, called
Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), to assess robustness of current or alternative
management rules to climate change. MSE is a multi-model framework that simulates potential
future scenarios of the population, fisheries and/or ecosystem (called operating models) as well
as the management system, from data generation to stock status estimation with a stock
assessment model, to management measure implementation. Like a flight simulator, MSE
enables us to test performance of a management strategy given a set of management objectives,
in a virtual world. We would not expect a management strategy to work well in reality, if it does
not perform well in a computer simulation.

MSE can be used to simulation test current and alternative management strategies under
potential future states to examine if management strategies are climate robust. Those potential
future states scenarios are developed using the Future Seas suite of statistical and process-based
models linked to future projections of California Current oceanography, and include potential
future scenarios of recruitment, growth, natural mortality, distribution and food web-interactions.

We recently completed an MSE for sardine that evaluated robustness of the assessment and
harvest control rule to projected changes in sardine recruitment (Wildermuth et al. 2023, @fig-mse). We found that there was no indication of increased assessment error under projected changes
in sardine recruitment. Furthermore, it was also shown that the current sardine assessment
process and frequency can effectively track changes in the population status of sardine, making
current management rules robust to changes in sardine recruitment as compared to more static
approaches. Other harvest control rules that are responsive to environmentally driven changes by
using dynamic reference points were also found to improve outcomes compared to static
management. Management performance for sardine in a changing climate likely depends on
frequent, responsive monitoring and assessment. See Wildermuth et al. 2023 to learn more! The
simulation code is also available at <https://github.com/futureseas/SardineMSE/tree/main>.
We are currently working on an ecosystem based MSE using the [Atlantis ecosystem model](Atlantis.qmd) to asses performance of forage fish harvest rules to climate-driven ecosystem
change, results to come soon!
