    "text": "Forage species, such as sardine, anchovy, and squid, serve a critical ecological function in the California Current as a link between the planktonic food web and higher trophic levels. Forage species also support important direct commercial fisheries. The fleet targeting forage species is referred to as the coastal pelagic species (CPS) fleet and composition of its portfolio varies regionally and over time given spatio-temporal variability in forage species composition across the U.S. West Coast as well as market forces. The fishery is the largest, and most diverse in California, with the main target species being market squid, Pacific sardine, mackerels and Northern anchovy. Of these, market squid is the most lucrative, and generates the most revenue. By contrast, the CPS fleet in Oregon and Washington has largely been dependent on Pacific sardine. In 2018 CPS accounted for 22% of total west coast landings by weight, and generated $82 million in ex-vessel revenue. In California, the CPS fishery contributed to 71% of 2018 total state landings. Key issues for this fishery include stabilizing catch from year to year, promoting efficiency and profitability given the high environmentally-driven temporal variability in species availability and portfolio composition, and maintaining adequate forage for predators.\n\n\n\n\nPacific sardine(Sardinops sagax)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbacore tuna(Thunnus alalunga)\n\n\n\nThe U.S. west coast commercial albacore fishery operates primarily out of Pacific Northwest ports in Oregon and Washington, using surface gear (hook-and-line and troll). The albacore fishery is economically valuable in all three west coast states; in 2015, hook-and-line vessels landed 11,255 metric tons of albacore to west coast ports, generating $29.3 million in ex-vessel revenue. Of particular interest for management are climate-driven distribution shifts of albacore (for example, in a warmer ocean albacore will likely move to more northern waters along the U.S. and Canadian west coasts) and the role of the albacore fishery, which is not limited entry, as “insurance” when other fisheries are not profitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe California Drift Gillnet fishery is a limited entry fishery that primarily targets broadbill swordfish in federal waters off California. In 2015, Drift Gillnet vessels landed 66 metric tons of swordfish, generating $454,000 in ex-vessel revenue. Due to documented bycatch of protected marine species including marine mammals and sea turtles, large-scale closures have been enacted to reduce interactions between fishers and bycatch species. These closures have resulted in lost opportunity and reduced profitability for fishers. To reduce opportunity cost to fishers while protecting bycatch species, we are exploring alternative management scenarios in which closures are enacted dynamically based on the likelihood that individual species are present in a given area.\n\n\n\n\nSwordfish(Xiphias gladius)"

    "text": "Fishers often target multiple species. More diverse harvest portfolios may reduce income risk, increasing resilience to climate-driven changes in target species’ spatial distributions and availability. Moreover, different effects can be observed across vessels in response to the same shocks and stressors, as fishers are heterogeneous. Evaluation of climate risk across different vessel groups within a particular fishery requires consideration of heterogeneous climate impacts on the availability of multiple target species and how such changes may impact substitution behavior. Here we analyze how historical climate-driven changes in forage species distribution and the closure of the Pacific sardine fishery affected landings per vessel of three coastal pelagic species (CPS): Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) targeted by the U.S. West Coast CPS fleet from 2000 to 2020. Using cluster analysis, we grouped vessels into different fleet segments and estimated heterogeneous responses by fleet segment and port area. Our results show that considering heterogeneity is essential in the development of equitable and effective adaptation policies designed to mitigate the impact of changes on species availability in these fisheries."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Climate-driven changes in ocean temperatures, currents, or plankton dynamics may disrupt pelagic forage fish recruitment. Being responsive to such impacts enables fisheries management to ensure continued sustainable harvest of forage species. We conducted a management strategy evaluation to assess the robustness of current and alternative Pacific sardine harvest control rules under a variety of recruitment scenarios representing potential projections of future climate conditions in the California Current. The current environmentally informed control rule modifies the harvest rate for the northern sardine subpopulation based on average sea surface temperatures measured during California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations field cruises. This rule prioritizes catch at intermediate biomass levels but may increase variability in catch and closure frequency compared to alternative control rules, especially if recruitment is unrelated to ocean temperatures. Fishing at maximum sustainable yield and using dynamically estimated reference points reduced the frequency of biomass falling below 150 000 mt by up to 17%, while using survey index-based biomass estimates resulted in a 14% higher risk of delayed fishery closure during stock declines than when using assessment-based estimates."

    "text": "Motivated by a need for climate-informed living marine resource management, increased emphasis has been placed on regional end-to-end modeling frameworks designed to project climate impacts on marine ecosystems and evaluate the efficacy of potential management strategies under changing conditions. The ‘Future Seas’ project was initiated with a focus on three fisheries (Pacific sardine, swordfish, and albacore tuna) in the California Current System (CCS). This work leverages a suite of climate, ocean, ecosystem, and economic models to project physical, ecological, and socio-economic change, evaluate management strategies, and quantify uncertainty in model projections. Here we describe the components of the modeling framework, considerations underlying choices made in model development, engagement with stakeholders, and key physical, ecological, and socio-economic results to date, including projections to 2100. Our broad aims are to (i) synthesize a large body of climate and fisheries research that has been conducted, and continues, under the Future Seas umbrella, and (ii) provide insight and recommendations to those pursuing similar efforts for other applications and in other regions. In general, our results indicate that all three species will likely shift their distributions (predominantly poleward) in the future, which impacts accessibility to fishing fleets, spatial management, and quota allocation. For similar integrative climate-to-fisheries projections, we recommend attention is given to: recognizing potential biases arising from differences between the climate products used for ecological model fitting and those used for model projection; how sources of projection uncertainty are prioritized, incorporated, and communicated; and quantitatively linking scenarios – especially socio-economic scenarios – with climate and ecological projections."
