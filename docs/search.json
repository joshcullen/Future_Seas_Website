    "text": "Forage species, such as sardine, anchovy, and squid, serve a critical ecological function in the California Current as a link between the planktonic food web and higher trophic levels. Forage species also support important direct commercial fisheries. The fleet targeting forage species is referred to as the coastal pelagic species (CPS) fleet and composition of its portfolio varies regionally and over time given spatio-temporal variability in forage species composition across the U.S. West Coast as well as market forces. The fishery is the largest, and most diverse in California, with the main target species being market squid, Pacific sardine, mackerels and Northern anchovy. Of these, market squid is the most lucrative, and generates the most revenue. By contrast, the CPS fleet in Oregon and Washington has largely been dependent on Pacific sardine. In 2018 CPS accounted for 22% of total west coast landings by weight, and generated $82 million in ex-vessel revenue. In California, the CPS fishery contributed to 71% of 2018 total state landings. Key issues for this fishery include stabilizing catch from year to year, promoting efficiency and profitability given the high environmentally-driven temporal variability in species availability and portfolio composition, and maintaining adequate forage for predators.\n\n\n\n\nPacific sardine(Sardinops sagax)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbacore tuna(Thunnus alalunga)\n\n\n\nThe U.S. west coast commercial albacore fishery operates primarily out of Pacific Northwest ports in Oregon and Washington, using surface gear (hook-and-line and troll). The albacore fishery is economically valuable in all three west coast states; in 2015, hook-and-line vessels landed 11,255 metric tons of albacore to west coast ports, generating $29.3 million in ex-vessel revenue. Of particular interest for management are climate-driven distribution shifts of albacore (for example, in a warmer ocean albacore will likely move to more northern waters along the U.S. and Canadian west coasts) and the role of the albacore fishery, which is not limited entry, as “insurance” when other fisheries are not profitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe California Drift Gillnet fishery is a limited entry fishery that primarily targets broadbill swordfish in federal waters off California. In 2015, Drift Gillnet vessels landed 66 metric tons of swordfish, generating $454,000 in ex-vessel revenue. Due to documented bycatch of protected marine species including marine mammals and sea turtles, large-scale closures have been enacted to reduce interactions between fishers and bycatch species. These closures have resulted in lost opportunity and reduced profitability for fishers. To reduce opportunity cost to fishers while protecting bycatch species, we are exploring alternative management scenarios in which closures are enacted dynamically based on the likelihood that individual species are present in a given area.\n\n\n\n\nSwordfish(Xiphias gladius)"

More diverse harvest portfolios may reduce income risk, increasing resilience to climate-driven changes in target species’ spatial distributions and availability.

Evaluation of climate risk across different vessel groups within a particular fishery requires consideration of heterogeneous climate impacts on the availability of multiple target species and how such changes may impact substitution behavior. Here we analyze how historical climate-driven changes in forage species distribution and the closure of the Pacific sardine fishery affected landings per vessel of three coastal pelagic species (CPS): Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) targeted by the U.S. West Coast CPS fleet from 2000 to 2020. Using cluster analysis, we grouped vessels into different fleet segments and estimated heterogeneous responses by fleet segment and port area. Our results show that considering heterogeneity is essential in the development of equitable and effective adaptation policies designed to mitigate the impact of changes on species availability in these fisheries."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Climate-driven changes in ocean temperatures, currents, or plankton dynamics may disrupt pelagic forage fish recruitment. Being responsive to such impacts enables fisheries management to ensure continued sustainable harvest of forage species. We conducted a management strategy evaluation to assess the robustness of current and alternative Pacific sardine harvest control rules under a variety of recruitment scenarios representing potential projections of future climate conditions in the California Current. The current environmentally informed control rule modifies the harvest rate for the northern sardine subpopulation based on average sea surface temperatures measured during California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations field cruises. This rule prioritizes catch at intermediate biomass levels but may increase variability in catch and closure frequency compared to alternative control rules, especially if recruitment is unrelated to ocean temperatures. Fishing at maximum sustainable yield and using dynamically estimated reference points reduced the frequency of biomass falling below 150 000 mt by up to 17%, while using survey index-based biomass estimates resulted in a 14% higher risk of delayed fishery closure during stock declines than when using assessment-based estimates."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Motivated by a need for climate-informed living marine resource management, increased emphasis has been placed on regional end-to-end modeling frameworks designed to project climate impacts on marine ecosystems and evaluate the efficacy of potential management strategies under changing conditions. The ‘Future Seas’ project was initiated with a focus on three fisheries (Pacific sardine, swordfish, and albacore tuna) in the California Current System (CCS). This work leverages a suite of climate, ocean, ecosystem, and economic models to project physical, ecological, and socio-economic change, evaluate management strategies, and quantify uncertainty in model projections. Here we describe the components of the modeling framework, considerations underlying choices made in model development, engagement with stakeholders, and key physical, ecological, and socio-economic results to date, including projections to 2100. Our broad aims are to (i) synthesize a large body of climate and fisheries research that has been conducted, and continues, under the Future Seas umbrella, and (ii) provide insight and recommendations to those pursuing similar efforts for other applications and in other regions. In general, our results indicate that all three species will likely shift their distributions (predominantly poleward) in the future, which impacts accessibility to fishing fleets, spatial management, and quota allocation. For similar integrative climate-to-fisheries projections, we recommend attention is given to: recognizing potential biases arising from differences between the climate products used for ecological model fitting and those used for model projection; how sources of projection uncertainty are prioritized, incorporated, and communicated; and quantitatively linking scenarios – especially socio-economic scenarios – with climate and ecological projections."

    "title": "Projected novelty in the climate envelope of the California Current at multiple spatial-temporal scales",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A useful measure of general climate stress is where and when novel habitats emerge. Here we evaluate ‘climate envelope novelty’–a spatial indicator of system-level habitat change–in the California Current System (CCS), by quantifying the emergence of novel ocean conditions in multivariate physical-biogeochemical space. We use downscaled climate projections from three earth system models out to 2100 under emission scenario RCP8.5, and detect novelty at multiple spatial-temporal scales using two methods (n-dimensional hypervolumes and extrapolation detection). Under high emissions, persistent novelty doesn’t appear until around 2040 and then only in small patches of Southern California and the Pacific North West. However, novelty increases rapidly after this (especially in warmer seasons), so that by 2060 up to 50% of the CCS in an average year has shifted to a novel local climate, which increases to 100% by 2090. These results are for the average year, and the first years to experience these levels of novelty typically occur 20 years sooner. The ecosystem will increasingly experience novel combinations of warmer temperatures, lower dissolved oxygen (especially inshore), and a shallower mixed layer (especially offshore). The emergence of extensive local novelty year-round has implications for the required ubiquitous redistribution or adaptation of CCS ecology, and the emergence of extensive regional novelty in warmer months has implications for bioregional change and regionally emerging fisheries. One of our climate projections showed considerably less novelty, indicating that realistic uncertainties in climate change (especially the rate of warming) can mean the difference between a mostly novel or mostly analog future."

    "title": "Projected novelty in the climate envelope of the California Current at multiple spatial-temporal scales",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A useful measure of general climate stress is where and when novel habitats emerge. Here we evaluate ‘climate envelope novelty’–a spatial indicator of system-level habitat change–in the California Current System (CCS), by quantifying the emergence of novel ocean conditions in multivariate physical-biogeochemical space. We use downscaled climate projections from three earth system models out to 2100 under emission scenario RCP8.5, and detect novelty at multiple spatial-temporal scales using two methods (n-dimensional hypervolumes and extrapolation detection). Under high emissions, persistent novelty doesn’t appear until around 2040 and then only in small patches of Southern California and the Pacific North West. However, novelty increases rapidly after this (especially in warmer seasons), so that by 2060 up to 50% of the CCS in an average year has shifted to a novel local climate, which increases to 100% by 2090. These results are for the average year, and the first years to experience these levels of novelty typically occur 20 years sooner. The ecosystem will increasingly experience novel combinations of warmer temperatures, lower dissolved oxygen (especially inshore), and a shallower mixed layer (especially offshore). The emergence of extensive local novelty year-round has implications for the required ubiquitous redistribution or adaptation of CCS ecology, and the emergence of extensive regional novelty in warmer months has implications for bioregional change and regionally emerging fisheries. One of our climate projections showed considerably less novelty, indicating that realistic uncertainties in climate change (especially the rate of warming) can mean the difference between a mostly novel or mostly analog future."

    "title": "Projected novelty in the climate envelope of the California Current at multiple spatial-temporal scales",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Given the ecological and economic importance of eastern boundary upwelling systems like the California Current System (CCS), their evolution under climate change is of considerable interest for resource management. However, the spatial resolution of global earth system models (ESMs) is typically too coarse to properly resolve coastal winds and upwelling dynamics that are key to structuring these ecosystems. Here we use a high-resolution (0.1°) regional ocean circulation model coupled with a biogeochemical model to dynamically downscale ESMs and produce climate projections for the CCS under the high emission scenario, Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. To capture model uncertainty in the projections, we downscale three ESMs: GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, and IPSL-CM5A-MR, which span the CMIP5 range for future changes in both the mean and variance of physical and biogeochemical CCS properties. The forcing of the regional ocean model is constructed with a “time-varying delta” method, which removes the mean bias of the ESM forcing and resolves the full transient ocean response from 1980 to 2100. We found that all models agree in the direction of the future change in offshore waters: an intensification of upwelling favorable winds in the northern CCS, an overall surface warming, and an enrichment of nitrate and corresponding decrease in dissolved oxygen below the surface mixed layer. However, differences in projections of these properties arise in the coastal region, producing different responses of the future biogeochemical variables. Two of the models display an increase of surface chlorophyll in the northern CCS, consistent with a combination of higher nitrate content in source waters and an intensification of upwelling favorable winds. All three models display a decrease of chlorophyll in the southern CCS, which appears to be driven by decreased upwelling favorable winds and enhanced stratification, and, for the HadGEM2-ES forced run, decreased nitrate content in upwelling source waters in nearshore regions. While trends in the downscaled models reflect those in the ESMs that force them, the ESM and downscaled solutions differ more for biogeochemical than for physical variables."

    "title": "Predictability of species distributions deteriorates under novel environmental conditions in the California Current System",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Spatial distributions of marine fauna are determined by complex interactions between environmental conditions and animal behaviors. As climate change leads to warmer, more acidic, and less oxygenated oceans, species are shifting away from their historical distribution ranges, and these trends are expected to continue into the future. Correlative Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can be used to project future habitat extent for marine species, with many different statistical methods available. However, it is vital to assess how different statistical methods behave under novel environmental conditions before using these models for management advice, and to consider whether future projections based on these techniques are biologically reasonable. In this study, we built SDMs for adults and larvae of two ecologically important pelagic fishes in the California Current System (CCS): Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). We used five different SDM methods, ranging from simple [thermal niche model (TNM)] to complex (artificial neural networks). Our results show that some SDMs trained on data collected between 2003 and 2013 lost substantial predictive skill when applied to observations from more recent years, when ocean temperatures associated with a marine heatwave were outside the range of historical measurements. This decrease in skill was particularly apparent for adult sardine, which showed non-stationary relationships between catch locations and sea surface temperature (SST) through time. While sardine adults and larvae shifted their distributions markedly during the marine heatwave, anchovy largely maintained their historical spatiotemporal distributions. Our results suggest that correlative relationships between species and their environment can become unreliable during anomalous conditions. Understanding the underlying physiology of marine species is therefore essential for the construction of SDMs that are robust to rapidly changing environments. Developing distribution models that offer skillful predictions into the future for species such as sardine and anchovy, which are migratory and include separate sub-stocks, may be particularly challenging."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Accurate forecasts of how animals respond to climate-driven environmental change are needed to prepare for future redistributions, however, it is unclear which temporal scales of environmental variability give rise to predictability of species distributions. We examined the temporal scales of environmental variability that best predicted spatial abundance of a marine predator, swordfish Xiphias gladius, in the California Current. To understand which temporal scales of environmental variability provide biological predictability, we decomposed physical variables into three components: a monthly climatology (long-term average), a low frequency component representing interannual variability, and a high frequency (sub-annual) component that captures ephemeral features. We then assessed each component’s contribution to predictive skill for spatially-explicit swordfish catch. The monthly climatology was the primary source of predictability in swordfish spatial catch, reflecting the spatial distribution associated with seasonal movements in this region. Importantly, we found that the low frequency component (capturing interannual variability) provided significant skill in predicting anomalous swordfish distribution and catch, which the monthly climatology cannot. The addition of the high frequency component added only minor improvement in predictability. By examining models’ ability to predict species distribution anomalies, we assess the models in a way that is consistent with the goal of distribution forecasts – to predict deviations of species distributions from their average historical locations. The critical importance of low frequency climate variability in describing anomalous swordfish distributions and catch matches the target timescales of physical climate forecasts, suggesting potential for skillful ecological forecasts of swordfish distributions across short (seasonal) and long (climate) timescales. Understanding sources of prediction skill for species environmental responses gives confidence in our ability to accurately predict species distributions and abundance, and to know which responses are likely less predictable, under future climate change. This is important as climate change continues to cause an unprecedented redistribution of life on Earth."

    "text": "A 2-day virtual stakeholder engagement workshop in support of the NOAA-funded Future Seas project was held November 28 and 29, 2022. Attendees included academic and government scientists as well as representatives of the National Marine Fisheries Service West Coast Region, the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, state agencies (California, Oregon, and Washington Departments of Fish and Wildlife), the Quinault Indian Nation, CPS (coastal pelagic species) fishermen, and CPS processors. The workshop began with an overview of the Future Seas project, including project aims for the recent phase 2 of the project, and a summary of the results obtained from phase 1. The rest of day 1 was dedicated to the socio- economic part of the project, while day 2 focused on the Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). The discussion was lively and productive and is detailed in this report. With input from all represented stakeholders, the Future Seas team was able to synthesize for the CPS fishery the observed target species dynamics, the key drivers that affect fishing operations, species portfolio and switching behavior, harvest location, port landings decisions and “no fishing” decisions, and key climate vulnerabilities, management strategies and performance metrics. These findings will guide the development and execution of the models elaborated for the project and ensure that they address the concerns and ideas of stakeholders. Attendees expressed appreciation for being considered in the modeling design and have interest in follow-up meetings with the researchers of the project as needed."

    "text": "A one-day management strategy evaluation (MSE) workshop in support of the NOAA funded Future Seas project was held March 28, 2018 in La Jolla, CA. Attendees included academic and government scientists as well as representatives of federal agencies (NMFS West Coast Regional Office; Pacific Fisheries Management Council), state agencies (California and Oregon Departments of Fish and Wildlife), non-governmental organizations (Monterey Bay Aquarium, Ocean Conservancy, Pew Charitable Trusts, Wild Oceans), and the sardine, swordfish, and albacore fishers (including the American Albacore Fishing Association, Western Fishboat Owners Association, and the American Fishermen’s Research Foundation). The workshop began with an overview of the oceanography of the California Current followed by an introduction to the Future Seas project, including objectives, timelines, and deliverables. The bulk of the day was dedicated to discussions of issues surrounding each of three U.S. west coast fisheries – albacore tuna, sardine, and swordfish. The discussion was lively and productive and is detailed in this report. With input from all represented stakeholders, we were able to synthesize for each fishery the key management objectives, stakeholder priorities, performance metrics, and management strategies. These findings will guide the development and execution of the project and ensure that it addresses the concerns of stakeholders. While issues surrounding management of these fisheries can be contentious, attendees expressed appreciation for being involved in the early stages of the project and interest in follow-up workshops in the coming years."
