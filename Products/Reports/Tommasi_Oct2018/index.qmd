## Workshop objectives

This workshop was aimed at engaging stakeholders in the coastal pelagic species (CPS) fishery
to advance development of CPS management strategy evaluation (MSE) in the region, with an
outlook to better understand how climate change will affect CPS fisheries. A key goal was to
discuss priorities and concerns in the CPS fishery, which inform the MSE process by indicating
appropriate management strategies and fishery performance metrics. This workshop was
organized by researchers from the SWFSC (the ‘Future Seas’ and ‘Coastal SEES’ projects) and
the University of Washington. The agenda used in this meeting is attached to this document.
